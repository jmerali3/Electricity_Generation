    "The nameplate capacity is the \"rated\" capacity of the power plant, but it's important to note that this is just a theoretical maximum. For example, a solar plant could be rated for 10 MW in sunny, perfect conditions, but in reality, it might only generate a fraction of that because the sun doesn't always shine. There is a name for this: [Capacity Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor). \n",

    "Below are capacity factors taken from Wikipedia for 2018. Natural gas is assumed to mostly be combined cycle (Cogen) and other is assumed by be biomass, geothermal, etc. Solar is assumed to be photovoltaic (PV)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Repeat Columns\n",
    "Notice rows 2-9. Looks like a repeat right (especially 5 and 6)? There are numerous rows that look like duplicates but are actually different modules of one power plant. For example, it could be two separate nuclear reactors at one site or two cogeneration trains at a natural gas plant. For the purposes of this analysis, it will be best to combine these with a sum these by technology to get the sense of the electricity generating capacity at a facility"
